Methods of generating bionomial co-efficients:
1.A 2D matric of coefficients can be created.
2.Use of recursion to query each C(n,k).
3.Dynamic Programming to produce 1D array for each n,k.

For few queries, Dp would be efficient. For frequent queries maintaining a 2D matrics is more efficient and computationally less expensive.
